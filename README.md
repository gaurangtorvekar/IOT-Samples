# IOT-Samples
This repo has a sample Smart Contract which enables IOT devices to log transactions on the blockchain. This allows you to record and trace back all of the logs to the device.
These transactions can be anything, from a camera recording the frames per second, to a coffee machine recording the number of lattes being served.

PLEASE NOTE that this is not production ready in any way, and serves as a sample for demo purposes.
